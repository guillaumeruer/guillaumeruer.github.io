        02 - Homeless Help

      <h2>Project introduction</h2>
      <div class="project__infos__container">
        <p>For this project my role was to lead the app and do the UX Design.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project was to design an app that will improve communication and help communities to come together and find those who are in need.</p>
        <p>Considering the target audience, the app needed to be easy to use.</p>
        <p>We also needed to make the process fast because people didn't had much time.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Research study details</h2>
      <div class="project__infos__container">
        <p>Our reseach questions were :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"How can we make users more incline to help others"</li>
            <li>"What can we learn from the steps that users take to find communities events"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the study we had 5 participants : 2 males, 2 females and 1 non-binary individual who were between the age of 18 and 50.</p>
        <p>The methodology was the following : 5 minutes per participant, New York and remote, with an unmoderated usability study. Users were asked to follow a prompt with a low fidelity prototype.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>

      <h2>User testing result</h2>
      <div class="project__infos_container">
        <p>The following themes emerged from the user testing :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The navigation is not intuive</li>
            <li>The workflow was complicated</li>
            <li>Users didn't know what to do</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To correct those points we added a homepage to list all the available actions of the app. Also we added maps to indicate events position</p>
      </div>
      <h2>High fidelity designs</h2>
      <img src="./assets//img/Homeless-high-fidelity.png" alt="High fidelity">
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <div class="project__infos__container">
        <p>Even though the app had a small number of pages, making an intuitive navigation was not that simple.</p>
        <p>People were getting more involved when the act of helping others was simplified with the app.</p>
        <p>For the future we need to add charity donations directly through the app and improver event's management. If people could create events through the app it will be event simpler.</p>
