        01 - Baltimore cafe's app
      </div>
      <h2>Project introduction</h2>
      <div class="project__infos__container">
        <p>For this project my role was to lead the app and do the UX Design.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project was to design an app to allow customers to order food menu items online before going to get them at the place.</p>
        <p>Considering the target audience of customers, we needed to make the ordering process easy to understand.</p>
        <p>We also needed to make the process fast because people didn't had much time.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Research study details</h2>
      <div class="project__infos__container">
        <p>Our reseach questions were :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"How long does it take a user to order food menu items in the app?"</li>
            <li>"What can we learn from the steps that users take to order food menu items"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the study we had 5 participants : 2 males, 2 females and 1 non-binary individual who were between the age of 18 and 50.</p>
        <p>The methodology was the following : 5 minutes per participant, at Baltimore or remote, with an unmoderated usability study. Users were asked to follow a prompt with a low fidelity prototype.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>

      <h2>User testing result</h2>
      <div class="project__infos_container">
        <p>The following themes emerged from the user testing :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cart is not visible enough</li>
            <li>There is no items suggestions</li>
            <li>Not enough feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To correct those points we added more feedback via notifications and suggestions based on user previous items selected.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>High fidelity designs</h2>
      <img src="./assets//img/Baltimore-high-fidelity.png" alt="high fidelity">
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <div class="project__infos__container">
        <p>Even though the app had a small number of pages, making an intuitive navigation was not that simple.</p>
        <p>User feedback was a key to understand that we needed more feedback on the app, and this feedback made the app more easy to use.</p>
